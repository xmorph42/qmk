* us now HOLD_ON_OTHER_KEY_PRESS_PER_KEY for LT(LOWER,ESC) and LSHFT_T(ESC) - seems to work good
  - Therefore removed the tapping term stuff for LT(LOWER,ESC) again which was not working for me

* Set tapping term 130 to LT(_LOWER,KC_ESC)
* - Ugh bad expierience. The 170 tapping term is definitive too long to activate the LOWER layer.
*   I have symbols on that layer (i.e. '{' ) which didn't fire when I type fast.
*   So I will set it also to 130

* added ESC as tap to 'LOWER' key using LT(LOWER,KC_ESC)
